## Key Features

- **DAO Voting:**  
  - Robust platform for decentralized governance.
  - Enables token-gated voting, proposal creation, and real-time vote tracking via smart contracts.

- **Crowdfunding:**  
  - Secure decentralized fundraising platform.
  - Incorporates smart contract-based escrow, conditional fund releases, and automatic refund systems to protect contributors.

- **Secure Smart Contracts:**  
  - Audited contracts featuring multi-signature security and time-lock mechanisms.

- **Instant Transactions:**  
  - Optimized for lightning-fast transactions with minimal gas fees using Layer 2 solutions.

- **Cross-Chain Support:**  
  - Compatible with multiple blockchains including Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum.

- **Community Driven:**  
  - Fully decentralized governance with transparent decision-making processes.

- **Automatic Metamask Wallet Detection:**  
  - Seamless integration allowing easy wallet connection and improved user experience.

## Deployment

Access the live application here:  
[Decentralized Application Development on Vercel](https://vercel.com/mohdquamartyagi-7279s-projects/decentralized-application-development)

### For End Users

- **No Installation Required:**  
  Simply visit the link above using any modern web browser.
  
- **Wallet Requirements:**  
  Ensure you have a Web3-compatible browser extension like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) installed and configured with your desired network (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum). The platform will automatically detect your MetaMask wallet.

### For Developers (Local Setup)

*Note: While the primary workflow is deployed via Vercel, developers who wish to run the project locally can follow these steps.*

#### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
- A package manager like npm or yarn.
- A Web3 wallet extension (e.g., MetaMask) for browser integration.

#### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**


   ```bash

   git clone https://github.com/mohdquamartyagi-7279s-projects/decentralized-application-development.git
   cd decentralized-application-development
   ```
  

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Use npm or yarn to install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   npm install   # OR yarn install
  
   ```
   

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   * Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   * Add the required variables such as:

     * `NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_PROJECT_ID`
     * `PRIVATE_KEY`

   Refer to the project documentation or inspect the codebase to determine any additional environment variables needed.

4. **Run the Development Server**

   Start the application locally:

   ```bash
   npm run dev   # OR yarn dev
   ```

   The application will typically be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

5. **Connect Your Wallet**

   Ensure your browser’s MetaMask (or equivalent Web3 wallet) is connected to your local development blockchain (e.g., Ganache, Hardhat Network) or a suitable testnet.
